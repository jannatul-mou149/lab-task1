        <h3>Web Developer | UI/UX Designer| Programmer</h3>
        <p>Hi there! It's Jannatul Ferdousi Mou you're visting right now. Let me introduce myself. I'm a Web Developer ,
            UI/UX
            Designer, Programmer.I'm Pursuing BSc in Computer Science and Engineering
            from Daffodil International University. And Currently living in Dhaka.</p>
        <p>For many people, working as a web designer sounds like a dream job. It's a career where you'll get to
            show off your passion and creativityâ€”and get paid well for doing so! But becoming a web designer
            requires a wide array of skills, which are best attained through web designer courses.
            By completing a web designer diploma program, you'll take yourself one step closer to that moment when
            you can begin designing websites. So how can courses prepare you for your journey, and help make your
            dream job a reality? Let's take a look.
            Obviously, creativity is a skill that web designers need since they create websites that are visually
            appealing. You may be a naturally gifted artist and have a passion for design, but if not, you can still
            learn the creative skills. For example, in your courses, you'll learn about colour theory, during which
            you'll gain skills in colour manipulation and how to use colour to give your work credibility and
            sophistication.</p>

                <h3>Web Developer</h3>
                <p>I have a very good knowledge in Web Developing both fornt-end and back-end and I also have my own
                    website. I do write articles in here about web developing and programming.Today's web development
                    landscape is full of innovative projects and intelligent people. Together, these factors push the
                    industry forward at amazing speeds, while also making it more difficult for individual web
                    developers to
                    be outstanding.

                    As a new developer, one of the hardest tasks is to create a successful web developer portfolio that
                    gets
                    the attention of potential employers, especially when the job market is overcrowded, and tensions
                    run
                    high.

                    Having a good web developer portfolio not only showcases your creativity and efficiency but also
                    highlights your level of expertise and professionalism.</p>
